# ASTEROIDS.io
### Proyecto Final - Diseño en Medios Interactivos

Asteroids.io is a multi-player variant of the arcade shooter *Asteroids*, initially released in november 1979. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game))

In this version, the game is displayed on a single monitor and using gyroscope enabled devices each player battles others players and competes for the highest score.

This game was developed as a [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketch and runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) using [Express](https://expressjs.com/). All multiplayer features are built with [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/).

All of the code is uploaded as it was presented in the final deliveries' showcase for *Diseño en Medios Interactivos* at *Universidad de Los Andes* on May 22, 2018.
